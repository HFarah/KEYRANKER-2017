# KEYRANKER-2017
This repository contains all the experimental results obtained during the evaluation of KeyRanker's performance. It is organized into three directories:

    "Evaluation": includes the experimental results obtained.
    "Dataset": contains the benchmarks used for the various experimental evaluations.
    "Tools": contains the versions of the tools we used (SAKey, LIMES, SILK)

A version of KeyRanker with the user manual will soon be added to the repository.
